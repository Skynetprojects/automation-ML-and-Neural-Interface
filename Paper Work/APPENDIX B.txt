Software Requirements

python version 3.9

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van
Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used for web development (server-side), software
development, mathematics, system scripting. Python can be used on a server to create web applications, alongside software to create workflows,to handle big data and
perform complex mathematics. It can connect to database systems and also read and
modify files. It is used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi,
etc). It has a simple syntax similar to the English language and the syntax that allows
developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
The libraries used in this work are Opencv, Tensorflow, sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, DlibPython runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed
as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. It can be treated
in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way. It is possible to
write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm,
Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of
Python files. Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. It relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and
classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with
human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical
resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for
industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.
Natural Language Processing with Python provides a practical introduction
to programming for language processing. Written by the creators of NLTK, it guides
the reader through the fundamentals of writing Python programs, working with corpora, categorizing text, analyzing linguistic structure, and more. The online version of
the book has been been updated for Python 3 and NLTK 3. The libraries used in this
work are Opencv, Tensorflow, sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Dlib. Python is
a must for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. The advantages of using
Python are
• Easy-to-learn :Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined
syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
• Easy-to-read : Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
• Easy-to-maintain : Python’s source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
• A broad standard library : Python’s bulk of the library is very portable and crossplatform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
• Interactive Mode : Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
• Portable : Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the
same interface on all platforms.
• Extendable : You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These
modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
• Databases : Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
• GUI Programming :Python supports GUI applications that can be created and
ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows
MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
• Scalable : Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than
shell scripting.

AURDUINO IDE

The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a cross-platform application (for Windows, macOS, Linux) that is written in functions from C and C++.
It is used to write and upload programs to Arduino compatible boards, but also, with the help of third-party cores, other vendor development boards.
The source code for the IDE is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2.
The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using special rules of code structuring.
The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring project, which provides many common input and output procedures.
User-written code only requires two basic functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, that are compiled and linked with a program stub main() into an executable cyclic executive program with the GNU toolchain, also included with the IDE distribution.
The Arduino IDE employs the program avrdude to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.
By default, avrdude is used as the uploading tool to flash the user code onto official Arduino boards.

OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision,also machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision
43
applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize
and modify the code. Features of OpenCV Library are
• Read and write images
• Capture and save videos
• Process images (filter, transform)
• Perform feature detection
• Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.
• Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and
track objects in it.
OpenCV was originally developed in C++. In addition to it, Python and
Java bindings were provided. OpenCV runs on various Operating Systems such as
windows, Linux, OSx, FreeBSD, Net BSD, Open BSD, etc

Keras

 Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
 Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.
Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. 
Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. Up until version 2.3 Keras supported multiple backends, including TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, and PlaidML. As of version 2.4, only TensorFlow is supported.

TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. 
Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.


CUDA Tool Kit

CUDA Toolkit Develop, Optimize and Deploy GPU-Accelerated Apps The NVIDIA® CUDA® Toolkit provides a development environment for creating high performance GPU-accelerated applications. 
With the CUDA Toolkit, you can develop, optimize, and deploy your applications on GPU-accelerated embedded systems, desktop workstations, enterprise data centers, cloud-based platforms and HPC supercomputers.
